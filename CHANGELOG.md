## [Unreleased]

## Added
- Support Python 3.13 and 3.14
- Typing for IDE autocomplete
- Support for EMOJI and CJK Unicode
- Support for `DatumInContext` in-place updating
- Support equality checking of `Operation` instances
- Support string serialization of `Union` and `Intersect` instances

## Changed
- Rename `ExtentedJsonPathParser`

## Fixed
- Fix `False` and `None` values
- Fix single constant case
- Update field filter to resolve wildcard path issue
- Vendor copy of ply and remove pickle support from the vendored copy to resolve [CVE-2025-56005](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-56005)
- Fix string serialization throughout the library to enforce roundtrip parsing consistency.
  - Fields are more conservatively enclosed in quotion marks
    This fixes serialization and re-parsing of `"00"`, `'%'`, `'0@'` and `"&'"`.
  - `Operation` instances can now be serialized.
    This fixes serialization of `0-@` and `A -A`.
  - `SortedThis` instances can now be serialized and re-parsed.
    This fixes serialization of `0[/0]`.
  - `Child` precedence is now preserved using parentheses during serialization.
    This ensures that serialized strings like `a..b[c]` serialize and re-parse identically.
- Fix parsing and string serialization of numeric-only identifiers.
  This fixes parsing of `10`, which was parsed as two separate fields.
- Fix equality checks for `SortedThis` instances.

## Removed
- Python 3.8 and 3.9 no longer supported
